                <h3>TIGER</h3>
                TIGERS
                <p>The largest cat of all, the tiger is a powerful symbol among the different cultures that share its home. But this magnificent animal is being persecuted across its range.</p>
                <p>Tigers are poisoned, shot, trapped, and snared, largely as a result of conflicts with people and to meet the demands of a continuing illegal trade in tiger derivatives and parts.</p>
                <p> On top of this, both their habitat and natural prey continue to disappear. Over the past 100 years, tiger numbers have declined by 95 per cent.</p>
<p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
<P>You will find tigers in the wild areas</P>
